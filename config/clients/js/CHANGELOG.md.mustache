    e.g. response that was `{"object_ids":["roadmap"]}`, will now be `{"objects":["document:roadmap"]}`

Fixes:

## v0.1.1

### [0.1.1](https://{{gitHost}}/{{gitUserId}}/{{gitRepoId}}/compare/v0.1.0...v0.1.1) (2022-11-15)

Regenerate to include support for [restricting wildcards](https://github.com/openfga/rfcs/pull/8) in authorization models.

## v0.1.0

### [0.1.0](https://{{gitHost}}/{{gitUserId}}/{{gitRepoId}}/compare/v0.0.2...v0.1.0) (2022-09-29)

- BREAKING: exported type `TypeDefinitions` is now `WriteAuthorizationModelRequest`
    This is only a breaking change on the SDK, not the API. It was changed to conform to the proto changes in [openfga/api](https://github.com/openfga/api/pull/27).
    It makes the type name more consistent and less confusing (normally people would incorrectly assume TypeDefinitions = TypeDefinition[]).
- chore(deps): upgrade dependencies

## v0.0.2

### [0.0.2](https://{{gitHost}}/{{gitUserId}}/{{gitRepoId}}/compare/v0.0.1...v0.0.2) (2022-08-15)

Support for [ListObjects API]](https://openfga.dev/api/service#/Relationship%20Queries/ListObjects)

You call the API and receive the list of object ids from a particular type that the user has a certain relation with.

For example, to find the list of documents that Anne can read:

```javascript
const response = await {{appCamelCaseName}}Api.listObjects({
  user: "anne",
  relation: "can_read",
  type: "document"
});

// response.object_ids = ["roadmap"]
```
